Figure \ref{fig:pcbs} shows the two custom PCBs for the IR LED arrays. These boards are completely separate from the main Computer Vision subsystem. This allows the user to position the Night Vision boards at locations of interest. For example, the user could position the Computer Vision subsystem above their front door and position one or more Night Vision subsystems near their vehicle or walkway. The flexibility of the Night Vision subsystem allows for greater customization to the end user, who can decide to either on-board, off-board, or not utilize the boards based on their needs.
