Due to anticipated difficulties in driving the IR LEDs, there are two design choices for the system.

\subsection{RPi2 GPIO-based Design}

In this design, an ADC chip is added in order to transfer the data from the lux sensor to the RPi2.

\subsection{Arduino-based Design}

The ``Arduino-based design'', in actuality, would be a ATmega series microcontroller design. Currently, the Arduino Uno Rev. 3--based on the ATmega 328--is utilized as a quick evaluation on whether hosting the LEDs on a microcontroller (and subsequent 5V source) would better serve the purposes of night surveillance.
