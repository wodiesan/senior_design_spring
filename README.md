# Scrying
A computer vision home surveillance system based on the Raspberry Pi 2. Utilizes the Raspberry Pi CSI camera module and OpenCV framework.

## Front matter
Origin: Senior Electronic Design I Project, Spring 2016  
Advisor: Professor Scott Grenquist  
Deptartment: Electrical Engineering and Technology  
College: Wentworth Institute of Technology  

### What is Scrying?
A low-cost, low-maintenance, Raspberry Pi 2-based home surveillance 
system. This system is designed to allow a homeowner to record digital 
footage. The system includes basic object detection. Recorded videos will
be cataloged by the object type that activated the camera, e.g. human, 
vehicle, and others. The result is a lightweight and scalable home 
surveillance system that remains inexpensive in storage.
