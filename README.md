## What is the Home Surveillance System?
A low-cost, low-maintenance, Raspberry Pi 2-based home surveillance 
system. This system is designed to allow a homeowner to record digital 
footage. The system includes basic object detection. Recorded videos will
be cataloged by the object type that activated the camera, e.g. human, 
vehicle, and others. The result is a lightweight and scalable home 
surveillance system that remains inexpensive in storage.
