## What is the Home Surveillance System?
A low-cost, low-maintenance, Raspberry Pi 2-based home surveillance 
system. This system is designed to allow a homeowner to record digital 
footage--through low-ambient environments--when a motion threshold is
surpassed. The system includes basic human detectionand object 
recognition features. Recorded videos will be cataloged by the object
type that activated the camera, e.g. human, vehicle, and others. 
This proposed functionality will allow a homeowner to quickly access the
database of footage through categorical "bookmarks" based on metadata 
such as date, time, and type of object. The result is a lightweight and
scalable home surveillance system that remains inexpensive for storage.
