\subsection{Anticipated Feature: Android App}

An Android app to view the livestream would greatly increase the accessibility of the Home Surveillance System. This feature was tentatively announced during the Proposal Phase, but time constraints limited the resources available for Android development. As a result, the Android app is currently on hold until the next major iteration of the system.

\subsection{Anticipated Feature: Servos}

User-controlled pan-tilt movements is a planned feature for the next major iteration of the Home Surveillance System. The tentative plan is to allow users to control the system through the website livestream as well as through the planned Android app.
